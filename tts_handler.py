    Converts a given text into an MP3 audio file using Google Text-to-Speech.

    Args:
        text (str): The text to be converted to speech.
        voice_selection (str): The language/voice to use for the TTS. 
                               For gTTS, this is primarily language-based.
                               The voice options in the UI are for user experience;
                               we can map them to different language accents if needed.

    Returns:
        str: The file path to the generated MP3 audio file, or None if it fails.
